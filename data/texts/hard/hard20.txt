Quantum computing: IBM's 1,000+ qubit processor (Condor) launched in 2023. Google's Sycamore achieved "quantum supremacy" — solving in 200 sec what takes classical computers 10,000 years. Qubit formula: |sai⟩ = a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ where |a|² + |b|² = 1. The future? $Unbreakable$ encryption & drug discovery. @IBM
